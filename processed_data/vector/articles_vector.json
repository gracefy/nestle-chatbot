    "content": "**10 Foods that Give You Energy**\n\nTheme: Brand\n\nLife is just so exciting – playing with kids, exercising, planning get-togethers. We need plenty of energy to do all the things we love! There are bound to be days when we feel like we could use more energy. Maybe we didn’t sleep well the night before, or we’re coming down with a cold. Or it could be because of what we’ve been eating and drinking.Nutrition to Fuel Your Body So, what is it that gives us energy? Of course, we know that caffeinated beverages and shots provide the feeling of quick energy, but what we really need is sustained energy – that is, energy from foods that fuel the cells of the body and keep us going strong. Specific nutrients to focus on include: 10 Nutrient-packed Foods to Help Fuel Nutritional EnergyKnowing the nutrients that contribute to energy levels is great, but how does this translate to the actual foods we eat? Here’s a list of what you can keep on hand to help deliver those energy-fueling nutrients:1.Bananas– If you’ve ever been to a road race, you know that bananas are a runner’s favourite food, both for pre-workout and recovery. That’s because bananas have a good mix of starch (slow-burning carbs) and sugar (quick-burning carbs). Bananas are also a source of vitamin B6, potassium and vitamin C.2.Pasta– Another favourite dish of athletes, pasta provides complex, starchy carbohydrates to give you sustainable energy plus fibre if you select whole grain choices. You’ll also get a variety of B vitamins and iron.3.Avocados– These green fruits (yes, they’re a fruit!) provide healthy fats and fibre, as well as pantothenic acid, a B vitamin that helps convert food to energy.4. Nuts– When it comes to protein, carbs and fat, nuts have it all. The fat in nuts is unsaturated, meaning it’s more heart-healthy. You also get a good amount of fiber, B vitamins, iron and magnesium.5.Salmon– Fish is a great source of protein, and salmon especially provides heart-healthy omega-3 fats and vitamins B3 (niacin), B6 and B12.6.Yogurt– Yogurt is made by fermenting milk using healthy bacteria to give it a versatile, thicker texture. Dairy-based yogurt is an excellent source of protein, vitamins B2 (riboflavin) and B12, and a good source of magnesium.7.Breakfast cereal– Ready-to-eat cereal has been a staple at breakfast for generations, probably because it is a convenient way to get you going for the day. Grains such as wheat, rice or corn tend to serve as the main ingredient in cereal, so you get energy-enhancing carbohydrates. Choosing whole-grain and lower-sugar cereal options will help keep your energy levels steady. Most breakfast cereal is also fortified with iron, B vitamins, magnesium and other nutrients.8.Oatmeal– Oats are a great way to start the day. They’re a naturally good source of carbohydrates and fiber, and they’re loaded with B vitamins like thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), B6, and folate (B9). Have you ever thought of preparing them as a savoury dish? Oats are a great base for additions like eggs, cheese, kimchi, curry, chili – the sky is the limit! If you prefer traditional oatmeal and want to up the protein in your oatmeal breakfast, make it with milk instead of water.9.Legumes– Beans and pulses of all types are economical and versatile bundles of protein, complex carbohydrates and fibre. Explore a variety of dishes from around the world using legumes and you may just find your next favourite, nutritious meal!10.BOOST® Nutritional Drink– When you want a variety of nutrients in one convenient serving*, BOOST® nutritional drinks are great option. As well as giving you protein, BOOST® beverages contain B vitamins to help convert food to energy and nutrient-rich calories that give you the nutritional energy you need to help you be your best.Find all these energy-boosting foods and beverages at your local grocery store. Look for BOOST® in the nutritional foods section of your local retailer. *Serving sizes vary",

    "content": "**7 Cool Ways to Enjoy Hot Chocolate This Summer**\n\nTheme: Brand\n\nHot chocolate isn't just for the chilly months! This summer, turnCarnation Hot Chocolateinto a refreshing treat with our playful and delicious twists. If you are looking for a cool summer treat, these ideas are sure to be a hit with both kids and adults. 1.Frozen Hot Chocolate Not quite ice cream but frostier than a milkshake, frozen hot chocolate tastes like a lighter version of those summertime classics with a chocolate twist. Just whip Carnation Hot Chocolate, milk and ice together in a blender until smooth. If you're looking for extra chocolatey flavour, add chocolate milk instead of plain milk or water. Non-dairy alternatives also work just as well. 2. Iced Hot Chocolate Transform Carnation Hot Chocolate into a cool, creamy beverage. Simply make your hot chocolate as usual, let it cool slightly, and then pour over ice. Add a splash of milk or cream for extra richness. It's like your favourite chocolate milk but with the deep flavour of hot cocoa. 3. Hot Chocolate Ice Pops Pour cooled Carnation Hot Chocolate into popsicle moulds, add a stick, and freeze. For a fun twist, layer with vanilla or strawberry yogurt for a Neapolitan effect. It's a perfect grab-and-go treat that will keep the kids cool and happy. 4. Hot Chocolate Affogato For a grown-up treat, place a scoop ofHäagen-Dazsvanilla or chocolate ice cream in a bowl, and pour a shot of espresso mixed with a shot of cooled, concentrated Carnation Hot Chocolate over it. This twist on the classic affogato gives you the boldness of espresso coupled with the rich, comforting taste of chocolate, melting over the creamy ice cream for an indulgent, multi-textured dessert. 5. Hot Chocolate Float Fill a tall glass halfway with chilled Carnation Hot Chocolate, then carefully add a scoop ofHäagen-Dazsice cream. As the ice cream melts, it creates a wonderfully creamy chocolate drink. Experiment with different ice cream flavours like coffee or salted caramel for a unique twist. 6. Sundae Toppings with Hot Chocolate Make a batch ofFrozen Hot Chocolateand top it with traditional sundae toppings for a fun treat! Looking for topping ideas? Here are some we recommend. Mix and match and make it yours! ● Whipped cream: Homemade or from a can, it’s the perfect frozen hot chocolate topper. Say “when!” ● A drizzle of your favouriteNESQUIK® Syrup: Looking for maximum chocolate flavour? Reach forNESQUIK®Chocolate Syrup. Want a perfect balance of tart and sweet? NESQUIK® Strawberry is your go-to. ● Carnation Hot Chocolate powder: Sometimes a little extra goes a long way. ● Shaved chocolate: We recommendAEROor AERO mint! ● Topped with crushed miniKITKAT: Crush them in the package if you want a quick and easy cleanup. 8. Cold Mocha Mix cooled Carnation Hot Chocolate with chilled coffee and pour over ice. Add milk or cream to lighten it up, and a touch of sugar if you like it sweet. This cold mocha is a refreshing pick-me-up on a warm summer day, combining the best of both worlds—coffee and chocolate. Have flavoured syrups on hand? They're also a perfect flavour injection! We recommend mint, salted caramel, or hazelnut. Hot chocolate isn’t just a cozy season drink anymore. With these eight ideas, you can enjoy its chocolatey goodness year round.

To celebrate them, we’ve launched a series of short videos to help you get to know the people of Nestlé. Next up: Andreanne Simard. Water is something I have always been passionate about. I grew up next to the St. Lawrence River; I’ve lived in communities beside the Great Lakes; I’ve been around groundwater wells for half my life and, now, my family has our own well. From a very young age, I had a profound appreciation for water. As my two young daughters grow up, I can see that same appreciation for water shine through in the way they value our water at home. My job now as a Natural Resources Manager at Nestlé Waters Canada is all about maintaining a safe, sustainable water supply. On a typical day at work, you’ll see me driving around in my pick-up truck, wearing my steel-toed boots and getting knee-deep in the wetlands that surround our community. I do a lot in the field, whether it’s measuring stream flows and water levels, taking samples or working with turtle experts. I love the outdoors because it fuels my passion for my work. I love that I get to work in the field of science, and that I learn new things every day. I think that this sets a really positive example for my daughters, teaching them that they can do anything if they have the passion. I think what I like most about my work is how it keeps me connected to my local community. You’ll often see me monitoring residential wells or holding community office hours for residents. I answer questions about water supply and listen to concerns from my neighbours. This is a really important part of my job that I take very seriously. I get a really good feeling when I’ve helped someone understand more about a resource that is precious to all of us. At the end of the day, we all just want a safe, sustainable water supply. Every day we’re learning more about our operations and more about the communities we’re in. And that’s really what my job is all about.",

I’ve loved working at Purina Canada since my very first week as a co-op student. Now that I’m a Marketing Manager, mentoring new grads, building co-op programs and connecting with young talent is one of my favourite parts of the job. After completing an MBA, I immersed myself in the world of marketing and quickly discovered a passion for bringing brands to life and learning about the consumer. I admit: I had reservations about working for a big company like Nestlé. But it only took a short time for me to feel totally empowered in my role. From the very beginning I felt welcome, and my team gave me the space to make my own decisions yet embraced the idea that making mistakes is a way forward. This unique culture of trust was the best thing for my career growth and has helped me to work my way up to a more senior role. What’s so great about working in marketing is that you get to touch so many areas of the company. Whether I’m sitting in on the early stages of research and development for a new product, working with the supply team, helping to design packaging or working with pets, I get the privilege of collaborating with loads of incredible people. I think what’s stood out most to me in my years at Purina is the culture. This is a place where the office pets are like family and where maintaining a work-life balance is a priority. I’ve always felt a sense of community at work. For me, it’s about the people (and pets) that make this place great.",

To celebrate, we’re launching a series of short videos to help you get to know the people of Nestlé, starting with Suzette Jordan.My role at Nestlé Canada is Director of Technical Applications. My friends wonder what that means, but basically, I’ve been thinking up and re-thinking the food we eat for over 29 years. I got my start as a Nutritionist, but what really led me to become a Food Scientist was a love of being in the kitchen. The process of perfecting a recipe is so rewarding to me. I also love hearing that satisfaction from my family when they’ve enjoyed eating something I’ve created, it makes all the effort worthwhile. I guess I strive to deliver that same feeling to Canadians through my work. In the almost 30 years I’ve been at Nestlé Canada, I’ve seen a lot of change in the food industry. Canadians care about the food they eat, and so at Nestlé Canada we’ve changed too - continuously improving the products we offer and providing Canadians with the information they need to make healthy choices for themselves and for their families. Canadian food preferences have evolved, they are looking for lower sugar, lower sodium, simple ingredients and higher protein options. Recently, we’ve seen the rising popularity of plant-based options. Canadian taste is constantly evolving, so at Nestlé, we are too. I think there may be a misperception out there that food science is all about developing ingredients, adding more ingredients, but these days it’s really about making the food we eat simpler and creating products people love. We’re always looking at ways to reduce sodium, sugar and saturated fats. Sometimes we start from scratch too, like withGoodnorth– a product that I was involved in developing. It’s a frozen treat that is high in protein, low in calories and has no artificial sweeteners. I’ve also worked on our confectionery line offrozen dessertsincludingRolo,Smarties,Kit Kat,Coffee CrispandTurtlesice cream. I love that some of these products I worked on over 20 years ago, are still family favourites today. Over the years we’ve continued to improve the sugar and saturated fat content in these desserts while maintaining the same delicious flavour.Developing the best possible products for our consumers has always been my number one priority. I take great pride in what I do, and the best part of my job has always been seeing people – especially my family – enjoy those products that I’ve helped create. For me, above anything else, it’s about making someone’s day a little bit better.",

    "content": "**Nestlé Canada Becomes a Founding Signatory to the Canada Plastics Pact**\n\nTheme: Environment\n\nNORTH YORK,ON, January 27, 2021- Today, Nestlé Canada joined the Canada Plastics Pact (CPP), a collaborative, solutions-driven initiative that brings together industry, government and social organizations from across Canada’s plastics value chain. The goal of the CPP is to drive significant system-wide change towards a circular economy by rethinking the way that we design, use and reuse plastics by 2025. “Our vision at Nestlé Canada is that none of our packaging, including plastics, ends up in a landfill or as litter. As the largest food and beverage company in the world, we are positioned to make a significant contribution to improving the health of our planet and to making a real difference,” said John Carmichael, Incoming President & CEO, Nestlé Canada. “We are a founding member of the Canada Plastics Pact and excited to work collaboratively with our industry and government partners to pioneer alternative packaging materials, support increased investments in recycling infrastructure, and drive recycling behaviour in pursuit of a circular economy.” As part of the CPP, companies like Nestlé Canada recognize that significant change is necessary to realize a circular economy for plastics. As such, more than 35 partners have joined the Canada Plastics Pact, representing diverse parts of the plastics value chain, from leading brands to waste management companies, government institutions, and NGOs. As a member of the CPP, Nestlé Canada has agreed to collectively make efforts achieving four ambitious goals by 2025: \"Joining together through the CPP is a diverse group of leaders from across Canada's plastics value chain,\" says David Hughes, CEO, The Natural Step Canada, the host organization of the CPP. \"While I am impressed by their genuine commitment to achieving a zero plastic waste economy, it is their willingness to break down barriers between each other to scale truly innovative solutions that I find most inspiring\". Canada’s Plastics Pact is the latest country to join the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Plastics Pact network, a globally-aligned response to plastic waste and pollution. In line with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s vision of a circular economy for plastic, the CPP facilitates innovation and knowledge sharing, and drives collaborative action and solutions tailored to Canada’s unique needs and challenges. Nestlé believes there is an urgent need to minimize the impact packaging has on the environment. Currently, 87% of its packaging is recyclable or reusable and Nestlé will continue to make progress on its efforts to make 100% of its packaging reusable or recyclable by 2025. Nestlé also seeks to reduce its use of virgin plastic by one third by 2025. These efforts build on more than a decade of progress and investment to achieve Nestlé’s ambitious sustainability goals. More information on the Nestlé sustainability plan can be found athttps://www.nestle.com. -30- About the Canada Plastics Pact The Canada Plastics Pact (CPP) is tackling plastic waste and pollution, as a multi-stakeholder, industry-led, cross-value chain collaboration platform. The CPP brings together Partners who are united behind a vision of creating a circular economy in Canada in which plastic waste is kept in the economy and out of the environment. It unites businesses, government, non-governmental organizations and other key actors in the local plastics value chain behind clear actionable targets for 2025. By aligning with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s global Plastics Pact network and the New Plastics Economy’s common vision of a circular economy for plastics, CPP Partners commit to fundamentally rethinking the way we design, use, and reuse plastic packaging.

Fish oil is a great way to add more Omega-3 to your diet and support cardiovascular health.* But maybe you’re allergic, vegetarian or vegan, or simply don’t like fish oil supplements. Don’t worry—we’re kicking off Heart Month with ideas to help you add heart-healthy Omega-3 to your diet even when fish oil is off the table. What Are Omega-3 Fatty Acids? Omega-3 fatty acids are considered “good” fats that are important for cardiovascular, metabolic and cellular health.* They are beneficial for the maintenance of your cells and several body systems and organs, including your heart, joints, brain and eyes.* Because your body does not produce Omega-3 on its own, it’s important to get these fatty acids as part of a balanced diet. The three main Omega-3 fatty acids include: While EPA and DHA are typically found in fish and other kinds of seafood, you can also get EPA & DHA as well as ALA from certain plant-based sources such as Algae and supplements. Sources of Omega-3 Fatty Acids Besides Fish Oil Many foods other than fish and fish oil contain Omega-3, including: Along with adding foods containing Omega-3’s to your diet, you could take supplements containing these important fatty acids.

    "content": "**Nurturing Brain Health for a Vibrant Mind and Nerve Function**\n\nTheme: Nutrition\n\nAs we get older it is common to start to experience cognitive decline. Following a few simple lifestyle changes can help support healthy brain and nerve function. Get Moving: There are many benefits of exercising regularly. Start slowly with a few minutes a day and increase the amount you exercise by 10 minutes every week until you reach your goal. The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology’s Canadian Movement Guidelines recommend adults between 18-64 years of age be active at least2.5 hours a weekto achieve health benefits (1) The benefits of exercise include, but are not limited to: Eat a balanced, varied diet: Specific nutrients in food – such as omega-3 fatty acids, have been associated with improved cognitive function in older people. (6) What’s in which foods? These are examples of foods that these nutrients are found in: Explore: The Mediterranean diet has been shown to provide a wide array of health benefits. Some studies have found an association between the Mediterranean diet and lower levels of cognitive impairment. (9) The diet is characterised by: Stay connected: Studies show that engaging with other people may improve cognitive function and maintain overall well-being. (10, 11) Reduce alcohol consumption: Try to reduce excessive alcohol intake. If alcohol is used inappropriately it can result in learning and memory issues and long-term alcohol consumption is associated with reduced brain volume (12). Whilst alcohol may help you drift off to sleep more easily, it can often interfere with sleep later in the night and reduce the amount (REM) sleep which is important for brain health (13). Tips to cut down: Schedule several days a week where you do not consume any alcohol. Switch off: Incorporating habits to help you unwind will help you have a better night’s sleep and support brain health. Not getting enough sleep can lead to trouble concentrating, loss of memory and other cognitive functions. Tips to support quality sleep: Supporting brain health doesn’t need to be complicated, keep it simple and try to incorporate a few of the above changes each day!",

In one particular study, breakfast skippers were consistently associated with lower micronutrient intakes, and it established a correlation between skipping breakfast and not meeting the recommended daily intakes for Calcium, Vitamin C, Folate, Vitamin A and Magnesium [1]. Another study found that chronic stress was related to poorer evening eating choices and more overall empty calories in the diet of those who skipped breakfast, whereas the dietary intake of counterparts who consumed breakfast did not appear to be negatively affected by chronic stress [2]. Breakfast helps give you the energy, strength and endurance to take on the day – especially if you’ve got a full day of physical activity ahead of you.

    "content": "**Benefits of Protein Supplements**\n\nTheme: Nutrition\n\n``` We’ve heard it time and time again: protein is crucial if you’re looking to shed fat and build muscle.[i]But what does protein really do? And what kind of protein should you be eating? Are whole foods best? Or should you be eating protein supplements? It’s hard to know what’s best for us with all the information out there, particularly since protein supplements have now become all the rage! Health stores, grocery stores, and heck, even convenience stores now offer a variety of bars, shakes, and powders to help you “get what you need.” The question is “what do youactuallyneed”? Let’s start with the basics. Protein is indeed the single most important nutrient for both weight loss[ii]and muscle gain.[iii] The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for adults is approximately 0.8 grams of protein per kilograms of bodyweight.[iv]For those involved with intense exercise, it is generally advised that you eat 1.3 to 1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight.[v] Protein is crucial if you’re looking to achieve tangible, sustainable weight loss results. It’s also now become clear that protein supplements, which were once thought to be a short-term fad, are now being recognized as a long-term, sustainable trend – because let’s face it – we may not always have enough time or energy to eat or prepare whole foods that are high in protein. Some people may have a hard time getting enough protein into their diet without a little help. Protein supplements generally contain 15-30 grams of protein per serving and are fortified with vitamins and minerals. They come in a variety of forms – such as nutritional drinks and meal replacements, bars, powders, and chips – and they can often taste pretty amazing with flavours such as strawberry, peanut butter chocolate, brownie, and even lemon coconut! While whole foods are generally best, I personally recommend protein supplements for post-workout nutrition. After working out, I prefer a whey protein supplement because of its high biological value (BV). The higher the biological value, the more amino acids and nitrogen your body retains from the food you eat. This means there’s more potential for muscle growth and strength. I also recommend protein supplements as a “grab and go” option for anytime life seems to get in the way. Because protein supplements don’t require refrigeration, they’re portable, easy-to-stash in your purse or bag, and therefore the perfect solution anytime you catch yourself in a bind. Additional advantages of protein supplements: • They are generally a more complete and balanced protein source • They are often fortified with vitamins and minerals, making them a multi-dimensional protein food • Many protein foods can serve as a low-calorie means to satisfy your sweet tooth Protein supplements come in various forms. The three most common sources of protein are whey, soy, and casein, but there are others that are becoming increasingly popular as well! Here is a breakdown of the pro and cons of various different sources of protein: When it comes to protein supplements, there really is something for everyone. Just keep in mind that when it comes to buying protein, as in life, \"you get what you pay for.\" Low-cost proteins often use inexpensive protein blends that may not be very digestible by the body. My recommendation? Test out various sources and quantities of protein to see what works best for you and your body! And yes, while I’m all about convenience, I don’t suggest you replace all whole foods with protein supplements entirely. They’re called “supplements” because they’re meant to supplement an already-healthy diet of nutrition whole foods.

B vitamins have many common traits. They are water soluble, are often found in the same food sources, and most function as co-enzymes (working together with enzymes) to perform functions such as metabolizing carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Some examples of foods that contain B vitamins are found below: If you are eliminating whole food groups, following a vegan or vegetarian diet, pregnant or of childbearing years, or if you have low energy or are under significant stress, you may be deficient in B vitamins. It’s always best to consult with your physician or registered dietitian to get an accurate assessment, as you may need more of a specific B vitamin. There are some symptoms you can look out for that may indicate you are deficient:[xviii] Taking a B complex supplement instead of one single B vitamin can prove helpful, as it allows all the B vitamins to work together and stay in balance, while taking only one could upset their balance. Although B vitamins are water soluble, it’s possible to take too much in supplement form. Some symptoms to keep in mind: Choosing to eat a variety of foods from all the food groups can help ensure you meet your nutrient requirements, including the B vitamins. A B complex, multivitamin or nutritional drink can be an excellent way to top up your daily intake on days when you may not get enough.

Unfortunately with age, collagen production declines. Citrus fruits such as oranges, kiwi, peppers, cantaloupe and watercress, which are packed with vitamin C, are willing helpers in a beauty regime. Carotenoids, (e.g. beta carotene, lycopene) which are responsible for the orange colour of carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, mango and papaya, are high in antioxidants and photo protective properties, protecting the skin against the sun.[2] Even though fruits and vegetables will never replace good sunscreen or adequate hydration, they can certainly help us look radiant from the inside out!

But did you know that protein is a particularly important piece of the post-workout nutrition equation? When you work out, you create microscopic tears in your muscles, and this micro-trauma not only requires rest, but also the right nutrition, to heal.[i]After a workout, your muscles are practically starving for nutrients, and a fast-digesting high protein / high simple carb meal is key. Post-workout, protein helps to: So what kind of protein should you eat? Well, the goal is to consume protein that’s fast-digesting so that it can quickly shuttle into your muscle cells. My favourite whole food meal is an egg white omelette with some sliced fruit and a slice of toast. Since a whole food meal typically takes more time to prepare and digest, I often recommend using a protein supplement to expedite the recovery process. Whey protein is my go-to because it’s rich in BCAAs (branched-chain amino acids), digests quickly, and is highly bioavailable. Consuming about 20-30 grams of fast-digesting protein after a workout will prevent your body from using its own muscle tissue for energy and will help encourage muscle synthesis. What does this mean? Better results and faster recovery for your next workout session. Alternatively, you can make a smoothie using a store-bought nutrition supplement, such asBOOST® High Protein™, to help recharge.

    "content": "**Two Critical Elements to Improve Energy Levels through Nutrition**\n\nTheme: Nutrition\n\nFood is our fuel. It gives us the energy we need to live the life we want. Food fuels our brains, nourishes our cells and energizes our muscles. But both the type of fuel we consume, and timing in which we consume it, affect our energy levels. Here are some tips to keep in mind to keep your energy levels up throughout the day! Timing:Our bodies require a constant supply of energy to function at their peak. If we wait too long to eat in the morning, or if we skip meals mid-day, energy levels can dwindle, our ability to focus and concentrate decline, and our motivation to exercise or be productive can be lost. One of the best ways to ensure you start your day with high energy levels is to eat breakfast within the first 30-60 minutes of waking up. Then, follow up breakfast with a morning snack three hours later. In two to three hour increments, follow that morning snack with lunch, an afternoon snack and dinner. If you find that you are not hungry for breakfast, think back to what you ate before bed. Often eating late at night can lead to loss of appetite in the morning. Since you don’t need fuel to sleep, the bedtime snack may have been simply stored as fat for use later. If you aren’t hungry for your afternoon snack, look at how your big lunch was. Ideally, if lunch was the right size for you, you should be getting hungry again about three hours later. Type of fuel:Carbohydrates are the most efficient fuel source for our bodies. Carbohydrate foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains provide energy that is easy to digest and absorb into the blood stream for delivery to our cells. Unfortunately, because we digest and absorb carbohydrates so efficiently, eating only carbohydrates doesn’t provide us with long-lasting energy.[i]To anchor the energy from carbohydrates, we need a source of protein such as meat, fish, poultry, legumes, eggs, nuts, dairy and protein powder.[ii]A perfect breakfast combination could include a slice of whole grain toast topped with a slice of tomato, spinach leaves and a poached egg. For lunch, a brown rice bowl with teriyaki chicken and sautéed vegetables. For an afternoon snack containing both protein and carbohydrates, try vegetable sticks and hummus, or berries and Greek yogurt. Certain nutrient deficiencies – such as iron deficiency, anemia and B12 deficiency – can lead to low energy levels. Heme iron, which comes from animal foods such as meat, fish and poultry, is easily absorbed and keeps energy levels high. Plant sources of iron such as legumes, nuts, whole grains and dark green vegetables contain non-heme iron, which is not as easily absorbed.[iii]Absorption can be improved by including fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C, as well as by avoiding coffee and tea at meals. Foods containing B12 include meat, fish, poultry, dairy and food fortified with B12 such as soy beverages. Always remember that there are many factors that may affect energy levels – proper hydration, sufficient sleep, daily physical activity and managing stress levels can all contribute to higher energy levels and a better quality of life!

There are several proven habits you can adopt in order to maintain vitality to help you get through your day! Experts recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate to intense exercise each week for Canadian adults.[ii]An example of moderate to intense exercise includes walking at a brisk pace for 30 minutes, which has been proven to provide a boost of energy.[iii]You know you have reached a moderate to intense level of physical activity when you feel slightly out of breath, but are still able to carry on a conversation. Regular exercise will also help you stay strong to accomplish everyday tasks, such as carrying grocery bags or tidying the yard on a spring day. How is your sleep routine? Research has shown that people who go to bed and wake up at the same time are more likely to have better energy levels throughout the day.[v]Ensure you get the same amount of sleep every night (between 7-9 hours is ideal),[vi]and avoid doing other activities in bed. Activities that involve staring at screens such as watching television or answering emails on your tablet or phone keep the brain awake, disrupting your bedtime routine. Ensure you have nutritious snacks on hand: fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, yogurt or hard-boiled eggs are all great food options that help raise your energy levels.[vii]Eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day can also help maintain good energy levels.[viii]If you didn’t have enough time to pack a snack made with whole foods,BOOST® Original™is a convenient option that can support your active lifestyle, with 240 calories (per 237 mL serving) to help keep you moving.[ix] Keep these tips in mind throughout your day, and remember: it’s the big picture that counts.

Like your brain is telling you to push harder, but you physically just wantto slow down? Well, what and when you eat before you exercise can make a huge difference to both your workout performanceand recovery. Prior to a workout, you want to eat something that will help you sustain energy, boost your performance, and preserve yourmuscle mass. Consuming protein in the hours before a workout can really help you maintain muscle mass, which is importantfor anyone that wants to get stronger and fitter.[i]After all, the more muscle you have, the faster your metabolism will be, which ultimately means you’ll burn more caloriesall day long.[ii]In addition to protein, carbohydrates are also a vital piece of the equation because they are your body’s preferred fuelsource.[iii]They not only give you the energy you need to sustain a tough workout, but they also help to preserve muscle mass and liverglycogen, which in turn helps increase muscle retention and growth.[iv] It’s a popular misconception that you only need carbohydrates if you’re engaging in more than two hours of endurance training.In reality, carbohydrates have been shown to improve high-intensity training as well.[v]So, make sure you get them in! Now, what about fat? Well, fat isn’t really a necessary part of the equation becauseit doesn’t appear to improve or diminish performance. While carbohydrates fuel performance, all fat really does is provideyou with some solid vitamins and minerals.[vi]While helpful in general, fat can also really slow down digestion if you consume too much – so be cautious of how muchyou include in your pre-workout nutrition! To fuel your next workout, try a well-rounded smoothie, combining the following ingredients in a blender: 1 scoop (about ½ a cup) protein powder 1 fist (about 2 cups) of veggies (spinach works well in smoothies) 1-2 cupped handfuls (1 cup) of carbs (berries or a banana work great) 1 thumb (1 tbsp) of fats (like mixed nuts or flax seeds) Low-calorie liquid like water or unsweetened almond milk (about 1-2 cups, depending on preference) And there you have it – some key pre-workout nutrition elements to help boost your workouts!

So, to reach and maintain a healthy weight, you have to change your daily habits…for life! It takes a little effort, time, and perseverance. Simply by moving a little more every day and by trying some of the meal ideas below, you may not only slim your waistline, but you’ll improve your health and daily vitality. Since fruits and vegetables, as well as milk and milk-substitutes, are among the foods most under-consumed by Canadians,[1]make them a priority at snack-time. No matter what or when you eat, it is important to respect your hunger signals and your satiety. Eat only when your body needs to fuel up. And remember that fruits and vegetables should be the focus of your meals. They are very nutritious, so they should make up half of your plate. Meat should be the side dish to your vegetables, not the other way around! This article has been sponsored by BOOST®, but all comments and opinions are my own.",

For example, older adults are already at an increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. This risk increases if they have an unhealthy body weight.[1]There are a number of methods to assess body weight, the World Health Organization and Health Canada use Body Mass Index (BMI) which can be calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared (BMI = weight (kg)/ height (m)2).Check hereto calculate your BMI.[2] There are many ways you can achieve a healthy body weight:[3] Canada’s Food Guide is a good tool to use to make sure you’re getting your daily vitamin, mineral and nutrient needs through fruits and vegetables, grains, milk and alternatives, and meat and proteins.[4]When at the grocery store, aim to do most of your shopping from the perimeter of the store where you can find the majority of these fresh and healthy items. Howmuchyou eat is just as important aswhatyou eat. Larger portions, the size of pre-packaged foods, and bigger plates and bowls can all contribute to overeating. To stay satiated longer, make sure you include protein on your plate. Consider a small portion of fish, meat or poultry, or try alternatives like eggs, beans or tofu. Dairy products like cottage cheese and yogurt also add a protein “punch.”[5] Adults should be getting at least 2.5 hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity each week, including muscle and bone strengthening activities.[6]Brisk walking, cycling and swimming are all great ways to stay active and manage your weight. Pick something you enjoy doing, and strive to do it on a regular basis.",

Evidence suggests that diet and lifestyle factors can have an impact on your memory and brain function![i]These factors can have positive impacts in many areas in your life. Here are some helpful tips to improve cognitive function as you age, and help decrease the risk of age-related cognitive impairment, including conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. It was once thought that food’s sole purpose was to provide energy for the body, but nutrition is now appreciated for its role in disease prevention. For cognitive function in particular, the fats and oils we consume are a key factor. Diets high in saturated and trans fats, often associated with “junk” foods, have been shown to decrease cognitive function, while diets high in polyunsaturated and omega 3 fatty acids have been proven to be heroes in preserving memory.[ii] Tip:The Mediterranean diet includes several foods that support our brain health and are high in healthy unsaturated fats:[iii] B vitamins – in particular vitamins B6, B12, and folate (B9) – play a role in homocysteine metabolism.[iv]Elevated levels of homocysteine is a risk factor for stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.[v] Tip:Eating a varied diet from whole foods can ensure adequate B vitamin intake:[vi] Antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, have been proven to decrease inflammation for healthier blood vessels, and can help reduce cognitive decline as we get older.[viii] Tip:Many foods high in vitamins C and E can be combined in meals or snacks:[ix] In addition to good nutrition, many other factors can help us maintain our cognitive function: Activities that exercise the brain, such as crossword puzzles, brain training games such as board games and card games, attending a workshop or learning a new language have been shown to help improve cognitive health in older adults.[x] Tip:Try out a new class at your local community centre to train your brain to learn something new! Cardiovascular fitness expands blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, maintaining brain volume.[xi] Tip:Get exercise every day. Try going for a 30-minute walk! There is published evidence which demonstrates that older adults with fewer social ties are at greater risk for cognitive decline.[xii] Tip:Join a social club in your area, call up a friend or make time to see family. It’s never too late to think about maintaining brain health and memory. Try some of these suggestions today to keep your brain at its best with small and simple changes that stick!

    "content": "**Four key factors for managing weight as you age**\n\nTheme: Nutrition\n\nThe gradual (or sometimes sudden) weight gain that occurs with age can be overwhelming and often very challenging to manage. Sometimes weight gain can be attributed to a slight slowing of the metabolism each year and decade, and some to changes in hormones, but these factors are not exclusively responsible for the shocking spike on the scale. So, what else might have contributed? Could it be the extra glass of wine you enjoy with dinner? Or a change in your activity levels or intensity? Or possibly the more frequent dinners out? Whatever the reason, weight gain can pose a health risk and should be managed. Here are four key areas to examine to ensure you are on the right track to manage a healthy weight as you age: When it comes to weight loss, the first place I start with my clients is energy. If your energy levels are fluctuating throughout the day due to inconsistent eating times and lack of structure, you need to start here. When you wait too long to eat, your energy level drops,[i]which not only affects your ability to concentrate but also causes your body to use muscle for fuel.[ii]If you consistently skip meals, this can lead to a loss of muscle mass and a reduction in metabolism. Skipping meals or snacks may also leave you feeling hungry or craving certain foods, putting you ant increased risk for overeating. What does one do? Start by eating breakfast within an hour of waking up. Plan to eat again every two to three hours during the day. Pack a snack for the car or golf bag and think ahead to lunch and dinner. When trying to lose weight, my clients often say they are constantly hungry. Although I remind them that feeling a little hungry as you approach your next meal or snack time is a good thing, feeling starved all the time is uncomfortable and unnecessary. There are several things you can do to improve satiety (feeling full and satisfied). Watch the extras; the extra glass of wine (140 kcal), the extra square of chocolate (70 kcal), the odd serving of fries (900 kcal) or the special coffee with whip (400 kcal) can all add up. You don’t need to be perfect, and I certainly don’t expect complete abstinence from your favorite foods. It’s important to allow yourself indulgences in order to stay sane and committed to long-term success. Just be mindful of your portions and don’t do it every day. As we get older, we might start to notice more aches and pains after intense activity. Recovery from injuries can also take longer, so we may need to modify our activity choice to stay fit. Keep in mind that if you have replaced running with walking, or hockey for golf, you don’t need as much fuel as you once did. Your potion sizes might need revisiting. If you have never really been a fitness fanatic, it’s not too late to start. For weight loss, I recommend four to five cardio workouts (which may be brisk walking for some, or spinning for others) and two strength workouts per week. Lifting weights not only helps build muscle which increases metabolism, but it also helps improve bone health.[v] The Bottom Line:Although there are some things we can’t change when it comes to aging and weight gain, there are many things youcanchange without too much effort. Select one goal at a time, make it a habit, and more on to another! This article has been sponsored by BOOST®, but all comments and opinions are my own.",

    "content": "**Do you know about these two common vitamin deficiencies?**\n\nTheme: Nutrition\n\nWe all know life can get hectic, which can have an impact on the foods we choose. The convenience of fast foods can tempt us away from the fresh, nutritious whole foods we should be eating. Eating a well-balanced diet is the best way to ensure your body gets the essential nutrients it needs to stay healthy.[1]But even doing this, you may still find yourself deficient in some vitamins – vitamin D and vitamin B12 being two of the most common. Read on for more about these vitamins and how deficiencies can be avoided: Vitamin D is key for bone health and protects against bone fractures.[2]Older adults may find it difficult to get adequate vitamin D, because it isn’t found naturally in many commonly consumed foods in Canada.[3]Vitamin D is converted by the sun is absorbed by our bodies, but this becomes more challenging in Canada, especially during the winter months. The recommended amount of vitamin D for those aged 51 to 70 is 600 international units (IU) per day.[4]Health Canada advises that adults over the age of 50 take a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU each day.[5]Many practitioners are suggesting supplements in the 1,000 – 2,000 IU range especially during fall, winter and early spring.[6]Incorporating foods such as fish, egg yolks and milk into your diet, along with beverages such as fortified orange juice, will help to reduce your risk of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin B12 is integral in creating healthy blood cells and keeping nerves working properly.[7]This vitamin is found only in animal-based foods, including chicken, beef, turkey, milk and yogurt. Because it gets more difficult to absorb vitamins as we get older, adults can become B12 deficient.[8]For a small number, adequate absorption is not possible even with supplementation, and injections are needed at regular intervals.[9]Much like vitamin D, vitamin B12 can be found in fortified beverages, nutritional supplements or tablets. If you feel you might not be getting the right amount of vitamins in your diet, be sure to speak to your doctor or health care provider.

    "content": "**Calcium: Are you Getting Enough?**\n\nTheme: Nutrition\n\nThere are many vitamins and minerals our bodies need to stay strong and preserve overall health. While many of these can be found in specific foods, our bodies require a wide variety and combination of vitamins and minerals to ensure it functions at an optimal level. One of the most important minerals, calcium, is critical to our health at all stages of life. But what makes calcium so special? From forming the structure of bones and teeth, to helping our heart, muscles and nerves work, calcium plays an integral role in keeping our bones strong and helping to prevent health conditions, such as osteoporosis, as we age.[1]Osteoporosis is a condition that causes bones to become thin and leads to increased risk of fractures, or broken bones. In their lifetime, one in three women and one in five men will experience a fracture due to osteoporosis – an unfortunate occurrence that is more common than stroke, heart attack and breast cancer combined.[2]But it doesn’t have to be that way! The daily recommended intake of calcium required differs for men and women, and changes at each stage of life. Men aged 50 and above need about 1,000 mg of calcium per day, while women in the same age category need about 1,200 mg per day.[3]To put this in perspective, one cup (236 mL) of milk has about 300 mg of calcium, ¼ cup (59 mL) of whole almonds has 93 mg and one cup of cooked broccoli has approximately 66 mg.[4] There are many ways to incorporate calcium into your diet to help you achieve your daily requirements. Here are some examples of how to boost your intake: It’s important to keep in mind that vitamins and minerals work together to help your body. One vitamin – vitamin D – can help the body absorb calcium, and can be found in foods such as fish, egg yolks and milk. Similarly, there are also foods that should be consumed in moderation because of their ability to inhibit calcium absorption. These include caffeine and alcohol, but also some healthy foods that contain oxalates (e.g., spinach, sweet potatoes, etc.).[6] Sunlight exposure can help many people meet at least some of their vitamin D needs,[7]which can in turn support the body’s absorption of calcium. If you feel that you’re not getting enough calcium through your diet, be sure to speak with your doctor or registered dietitian, who can give you more information.

    "content": "**The Pros of Protein**\n\nTheme: Nutrition\n\nProtein is one of the most important parts of your diet. Required to build everything in your body from muscle and bone to skin and hair, protein is also a key component for growth and repair. The protein that you eat is digested and eventually broken down into smaller building blocks called amino acids, which your body can then use to build new proteins. What many people don’t know is that while our bodies can create most of these amino acids, there are nine “essential amino acids” that we have to get from our diets, either from animal or plant foods. If you’re over the age of 19, it’s recommended that you get at least 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of your body weight each day. This number may increase depending on your age, activity level, and health. A simple calculation that you can use[1]is: Protein is found in a wide variety of foods. Good sources of protein (see chart below for types of foods and amount of protein in each) include meats, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy products, beans and legumes, nuts and seeds. It’s important that you have a source of protein with each meal and snack to help you feel full and satisfied longer because it takes longer to digest protein than a meal or snack of carbohydrates. If you find it difficult to get enough protein in your diet each day, a simple, quick solution is to try a nutrition drink likeBOOST® High Protein, which includes 15g of high-quality protein and only 240 calories. Another good source of protein that many people often include in their diet is protein powder (such as whey protein). It is important to note that some protein powders do not contain additional nutrients such as vitamins and minerals.BOOST® High Proteincontains 26 vitamins and minerals, including calcium and vitamin D, to help meet your daily nutritional needs. Protein is important for every organ and tissue in our body, so the next time you’re planning a meal or ordering at a restaurant, be sure to include a source of protein. Your body will thank you!

    "content": "**All About Protein: What, Where, How Much and More**\n\nTheme: Nutrition\n\nIn the battle between low-carb and low-fat, protein seems to be the good guy that’s sitting in the middle. Why is protein good for us, and how much should we eat? We’ve got the low-down: Proteins are molecules made up of amino acids which essentially serve as the building blocks for all the cells in our body. Adequate protein intake is important in helping us prevent muscle and bone loss as we age, and it also helps to maintain a strong immune system. Compared to carbohydrates and fat, protein is more satisfying, making us feel fuller for longer. It is thought that this is partly due to the fact that it slows digestion, which in turn helps to blunt the blood sugar response and give us a steady release of energy instead of sugar highs with the subsequent crash. The current guidelines recommend that a typical adult consume 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 g/lb) per day. In other words, a 70 kg (154 lb) person would require 56 g of protein per day. However, many studies suggest that protein needs, especially for adults over the age of 65, are higher than this,at 1-1.2 g/kg (0.45-0.54 g/lb) per day. If you engage in regular physical activity, your needs may be even higher than this. The average person does not need more than 2 g/kg (0.9 g/lb) of protein per day. While it was previously thought that high protein intakes can harm your kidneys[1], recent studies show that too much protein is only harmful if you already have existing kidney issues. Though excess protein itself is not harmful for most people, including too much protein in your diet could mean you are missing out on other important nutrients and foods that promote good health. A balanced diet should include protein-rich foods, but should also include vegetables, fruit, whole grains and healthy fats. In general, the foods in the Milk & Alternatives and Meat & Alternatives groups inCanada’s Food Guideare the main sources of protein in our diet. Whole grains and vegetables also contain small amounts of protein. Most people should be able to meet their protein needs with a balanced diet, but if you struggle to meet your protein needs through food alone, a protein supplement or nutritional drink such asBOOST® High Proteinmay be helpful.

Enjoying protein-rich foods from a range of different foods will help you get a variety of important vitamins and minerals along with your protein. Most healthy adults need an average of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. If you exercise often and at a high intensity, your protein needs will be even higher. If you do strength or endurance training at least 3 times a week, your protein needs could rise to 1.5 to 2 times the average level.[2]Adults who are 55 years and over should aim for about 1.2 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight per day to help maintain their muscle mass and overall health. A suggested guide would be to try to eat about 20 to 30 grams of protein in each meal and about 15 to 25 g of protein right after you exercise. This protein will help with muscle repair and growth and promote a faster recovery.[3] Higher levels of protein intake can be tough for some people to achieve, so try to include a high quality source of protein at each meal and snack to get you closer to your daily goal. With a little planning, you will soon be on your way to reaching your daily protein goals. You can also reach for a nutritional drink on the go, after a workout, or if you’re in a pinch for a high protein, nutrient-rich, satisfying snack.

    "content": "**Is Protein the Key to Anti-Aging?**\n\nTheme: Nutrition\n\nMany people have resigned themselves to the idea that health issues come part and parcel with aging –fatigue, muscle loss, frequent illness – it’s all natural, right? What if it doesn’t have to be that way? It is true that there are changes in our body that naturally occur with age, such as decreased metabolism, loss of appetite and increased risk of chronic disease. However, our lifestyle choices can impact the rate at which these changes occur, helping us to age with vitality and grace. While fat and carbohydrates seem to take turns being the “bad guy,” protein is the nutrient that has weathered the diet wars relatively unscathed. As the building blocks of virtually all the cells in our body, protein has a role in helping us maintain our muscle and bone mass, and reducing the risk of conditions like osteoporosis. Protein also helps us to maintain a healthy immune system, and to slow digestion, which in turn stabilizes blood sugar and energy levels. Due to the many benefits of protein for older adults, as well as the fact that our bodies become less efficient at using protein as we age, experts are recommending higher protein intakes for adults age 55 and over, and particularly for those over the age of 65. The problem is, the cards seem stacked against older adults when it comes to meeting protein needs – protein-rich foods like meat or eggs generally take more time and energy to prepare. Another concern is that most people do not spread their protein intake evenly throughout the day. It is common for people to get most of their protein at their dinner meal. Since our bodies are only able to absorb and use a certain amount of protein at a time, many researchers and health professionals are suggesting that we should include protein-rich foods at every meal, striving for 25-30 g protein[1],[2],[3]at a time. In practical terms, this may mean topping your morning toast with some peanut butter, cheese, or an egg, or adding cooked meat or canned beans to your soup at lunch. If you struggle to meet your protein needs through food alone, a protein supplement or nutritional drink may help, so that you can stay strong and healthy, and get the most out of life.

    "content": "**Packing on the Protein as You Age**\n\nTheme: Nutrition\n\nAs we age, it’s important to stay on top of the changing health needs of our bodies to make sure they have what they need to stay strong and healthy year after year. One important nutrient for healthy aging is protein. Protein is essential for building and repairing muscles, organs and tissues, fighting infection, healing wounds, and is an overall important source of energy. It’s safe to say that protein becomes even more important over time! How much protein we need is based on our body weight. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein for adults is 0.8g/kg body weight. However, experts recommend that those 65 and older need closer to 1.0-1.2g/kg body weight.[1]As an example, someone aged 65 or over weighing 150 lbs (68 kg) would need roughly 68-81g of protein each day. Getting enough protein in your diet will help ensure you have protein reserves in case you become ill, keeping your immune system strong and improving wound healing.[2]But perhaps most importantly, for adults 55 and over, getting enough protein helps maintain and protect muscle mass, which tends to decline over time and is more difficult to build as we age. To be sure you get enough protein, try to include a protein food at each meal and with some snacks. For breakfast, have an egg or 2 tablespooons of nut butter on toast, add ¾ of a cup of Greek yogurt to canned fruit for snacks, fill your sandwich with tinned tuna at lunch and add ¾ of a cup of lentils to your pasta sauce at dinner. For more ideas on how to add more protein to your diet, take a look at this article, All About Protein. This article has been sponsored by BOOST, but all comments and opinions are my own.",

This comes ahead of schedule from our original goal date of December 2016. The reduction in sodium is one of many global commitments we have made to improve the nutritional profile of our products. In addition to meeting our own sodium commitments, 90 per cent of our products across our frozen meals, pizza, ice cream, beverages and confectionery brands already meet Health Canada’s maximum sodium targets. “We've been working steadily to reduce sodium to provide better choices while retaining the same great taste in our products,” said Shelley Martin, President and CEO, Nestlé Canada. “While achieving this commitment is a significant accomplishment, our focus is to continuously improve our products and we will continue to look for opportunities to reduce sodium even further.” Progress to-date in Canada includes: Our sodium reduction efforts are carefully implemented in accordance with the Nestlé Nutrition Profiling System and the Nestlé Nutritional Foundation criteria (NNF). It’s important that the improved products deliver a stronger nutritional profile without compromising taste or food safety. Recipes are tested with consumer panels and at least 60 out of 100 people must prefer the Nestlé product over the competitor’s.For more information on Nestlé’s nutrition, health and wellness commitments, please visitcorporate.nestle.ca/en/creatingsharedvalue.",

    "content": "**The Evolution of Eating**\n\nTheme: Nutrition\n\nWe believe the food industry and other key stakeholders play an important role in helping Canadians improve their eating habits. And as a leader in the industry, we continue to innovate and reformulate our products to make them the best they can be. In order to do this, we need to understand where, when and how Canadians are eating. To help start the conversation, we invited thought-leaders in the nutrition arena to a symposium calledThe Evolution of Eating in Canada. During the event, we examined emerging trends in the Canadian diet and the way Canadians eat. For the first time, The University of Toronto presented an in-depth look at a study designed to understand the nutrition and dietary patterns of Canadians. Based on the latest Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) consumption data, the study found that the diet quality of Canadians is ‘poor’. That’s why the symposium set out to address Canada’s nutritional landscape and provide stakeholders with knowledge to improve their eating habits. “In our study, we saw a U-shaped curve that reflects the quality of eating habits among the Canadian population,” said Mary R. L’Abeé, PhD, Earl W. McHenry Professor and Chair, Department of Nutritional Sciences Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto and Lead Research on the study. “In early life, when parents have the most influence, the nutritional quality of foods that young children eat is generally quite good. Choices start to deteriorate in late childhood and are at their worst in adolescence, then start to improve as Canadians enter their late twenties and early thirties.” Other key findings of the research include: • Thirty per cent of total calories are consumed from food and beverages not recommended in the Eating Well with Canada’s Food Guide (EWCFG) • Snacking makes up to 25 per cent of the daily energy intake for children, and 23 per cent for adolescents. For these two groups, snacking contributed more calories than breakfast • Most calories were consumed at home (88 per cent, 81 per cent and 83 per cent for children, adolescents and adults respectively), however, for individuals who ate at locations other than home, on average 40 per cent of daily calories (about 1000 Kcal/day) were consumed at these locations. “Understanding more about what Canadians are eating is essential for us as we continue to reformulate and improve our products and help Canadians make informed food choices,” said Shelley Martin, President & CEO, Nestlé Canada. Case in point, we’ve made some fundamental changes to our packaging. We have committed to having portion guidance on the packaging of all ‘kids and family’ products to help you make informed food choices as a part of a balanced diet for yourself and your family. This is why, by the end of the year, we will include nutritional information on the front of the packages of key products, to provide instant access to the nutrition of what people are buying and eating. But packaging is only half the battle. By the end of the year, we will have reduced sodium, sugar, and saturated fat in our products by 10%. And that’s just a start. We never stop trying to improve, because how we eat is constantly evolving. This is one more way we are delivering on our Good Food, Good Life philosophy.",

In fact, we’ve being around so long that John A. MacDonald was Prime Minister when we first started doing business in Canada in 1887. It’s with this long history in mind that we’re focusing on Canada’s future. We care deeply about our home and all Canadians, and we’re doing our part when it comes to nutrition, health and wellness, sustainability and social impact. We want to provide a transparent update on how we’re tracking against our goals, which we aim to do by sharing our 2015 Creating Shared Value Report. While the report is a look back on our progress so far, throughout 2016 we’ll be working to continuously improve our products, our company and our place in Canadians’ lives. A few examples of the goals we’re working towards this year include: •Improving the nutritional profileof a range of our products, by reducing sodium, saturated fat, and sugar by 10% by the end of 2016. For example, we’ve already reduced the sugar content in our Ready-to-Drink Carnation Breakfast Essentials by 40% • Offering more than5,000 young Canadiansa chance to develop and expand their professional skills, and increase their employability over three years through Nestlé’s Youth Initiative. After just launching at the end of 2015, 1,800 students have already participated in our readiness for work events • Completelyeliminating the waste we send to landfillsfrom our factories by 2020. As of 2015, we’ve already achieved zero waste-to-landfill in three Ontario-based factories: our ice cream factory in London, our chocolate factory in Toronto, and our foodservice factory in Trenton By improving our ecological footprint, supporting young Canadians and improving the nutritional value of our products we’re working tirelessly to improve everything we do. We know we’re not perfect and have a long journey in front of us, but we’re committed to providing the best for Canadians and providing updates along the way.
