Slowly add the granulated sugar (1 tbsp at a time) beating the whites until the peaks are stiff and the mixture becomes glossy.

Scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula.

Melt the butter, swirling the pan until the butter starts to brown and smells nutty. Set aside. In the meantime, combine flour and sugar in a large bowl. Make a well, add the eggs and mix well. Slowly whisk the milk in, mixing until incorporated before pouring more. Add the brown butter and mix well. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. Set up your crepe station. Heat the frying pan you used to melt the butter on medium high heat. Have your bowl with the crepe batter and a ladle ready, as well as a plate to place the cooked crepes and a piece of foil to keep them warm. In a little bowl, pour the oil, and place a piece of paper towel in. Once ready, use the soaked paper towel to dab the pan with oil. This will allow you to have enough oil on the pan to cook the crepes, without frying them, which will make them lighter and fluffier. With a ladle, pour about 1/4 of a cup of the crepe batter and swirl the pan, making sure that the batter covers all the surface. Cook for 1 minute and half to 2 minutes, flip and cook for an extra 30 seconds. Set aside on a plate, cover with foil. Repeat with the remaining oil and batter. To serve, place 3 crepes on a plate, scoop one scoop of HÄAGEN-DAZS® White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Ice Cream, drizzle with the warm coulis and garnish with fresh raspberries.Enjoy immediately!

Have your bowl with the crepe batter and a ladle ready, as well as a plate to place the cooked crepes and a piece of foil to keep them warm. In a little bowl, pour the oil, and place a piece of paper towel in. Once ready, use the soaked paper towel to dab the pan with oil. This will allow you to have enough oil on the pan to cook the crepes, without frying them, which will make them lighter and fluffier. With a ladle, pour about 1/4 of a cup of the crepe batter and swirl the pan, making sure that the batter covers all the surface. Cook for 1 minute and half to 2 minutes, flip and cook for an extra 30 seconds. Set aside on a plate, cover with foil. Repeat with the remaining oil and batter. To serve, place 3 crepes on a plate, scoop one scoop of HÄAGEN-DAZS® White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Ice Cream, drizzle with the warm coulis and garnish with fresh raspberries.Enjoy immediately! Cook the crêpes on one side until they’re mostly done and then flip until done – the secret to keeping them soft and fluffy!\nStats: Prep time: None, Cook time: None, Total time: Total time:20 mins., Servings: Servings:8 Crêpes à la mode",

Noodles are economical to produce and could be dried and kept for long periods of time. The amount of rice used to make noodles was 50 per cent of what would be consumed if it was eaten unprocessed, so noodles essentially doubled Thailand’s rice stores. Colorful vegetables stir-fried with rice noodles and a lip-smacking sauce make this a delicious and easy alternative to take-out.Some of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada. Therefore we encourage you wherever possible to find local alternative products.

In fact, doubles have garnered worldwide attention, even having their own national day of celebration on May 30.\nIngredients: 2/3 cup (150 mL) Perrier Sparkling Water, 1 tsp (5 mL) quick-rising (instant) yeast, 1/4 tsp (1 mL) granulated sugar, 2 cups (500 mL) all-purpose flour, 1 tsp (5 mL) curry powder, 1/2 tsp (2 mL) ground cumin, 1/2 tsp (2 mL) ground turmeric, 4 cups (1 L) vegetable oil, for frying, 1 tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil, 1 onion, diced, 4 cloves garlic, minced, 1 tbsp (15 mL) minced fresh gingerroot, 1 pkg (36 g) MAGGI So Juicy – Garlic seasoning, 1 small Scotch bonnet pepper, seeded and diced, 4 tsp (20 mL) curry powder, 1/4 tsp (1 mL) salt, 1 can (400 mL/14 oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed, 2 cups (500 mL) shredded green cabbage, 2 green onions, sliced, 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced, 1/2 cup (125 mL) shredded carrot, 1/4 cup (60 mL) mayonnaise, 2 tbsp (30 mL) freshly squeezed lime juice, 1/4 tsp (1 mL) salt, 1/4 tsp (1 mL) black pepper, Pinch ground celery seed, 1/2 cup (125 mL) mango chutney\nInstructions: Fry Bread: In small bowl, stir together sparkling water, yeast and sugar In medium bowl, whisk together flour, curry powder, cumin and turmeric; fold in yeast mixture to form a dough.

This sweet and interactive snack is now a popular attraction at sugar shacks (or cabane à sucre) across the country during harvest season.\nIngredients: 8 cups crushed ice, 1 1/2 cups (375 mL) maple syrup, 1/2 cup (125 mL) Nesquik Chocolate Syrup, 1/4 cup (60 mL) Milo Chocolate Malt Drink Mix\nInstructions: Pat crushed ice into large baking dish or serving tray and keep frozen. In a small saucepan set over medium heat, add maple syrup.

    "content": "Recipe: Nescafé Leche Flan\nBrand: NESCAFÉ\nDescription: Leche Flan is a beloved Filipino dessert, but we're putting a twist on the traditional recipe by adding Nescafé Rich Instant Coffee. This decadent caramel custard recipe only requires a few simple ingredients and is perfect for any family celebration.Use any kind of Nescafé instant coffee or espresso that you have on hand.\nIngredients: 1 cup sugar, 2 tbsp Nescafé Rich Instant Coffee, 1 tbsp Hot Water, 1 can Evaporated Milk (354ml), 1 can Condensed Milk (300ml), 8 Egg Yolks\nInstructions: Preheat the oven to 325F. Lightly spray the insides of 8 medium (6 oz) ramekins with cooking spray. Place the ramekins on a rimmed baking tray. Note: If desired, traditional Llanera flan pans can be used instead of individual ramekins. Place sugar in long handled, small sized, heavy bottomed saucepan over low heat. Let sugar begin to melt around the edges of the pan, then swirl pan around a few times, every so often. Don't let sugar boil or bubble and don't use a stirring spoon. Keep swirling till all the sugar has melted and turned darker in colour, about 3 - 4 min. Switch off stove and swirl saucepan on warm stove for a few more seconds to darken caramel further without risk of burning. Pour caramel mixture evenly into prepared ramekins. Set aside to cool 5 minutes. Note: Caramel will be very hot at this point, do not touch it with your fingers or stir with a spoon. Mix instant coffee with water until completely dissolved. Whisk together evaporated milk, condensed milk, and coffee liquid in mixing bowl. Add eggs yolks and whisk until smoothly incorporated. Strain custard mixture through a fine mesh sieve if desired. Pour custard mixture into prepared ramekins, filling them about three quarters to the top, using about ¾ cup of the custard mixture per ramekin. Fill a large jug or saucepan with tap hot water. Place tray in oven, then slowly pour in the water into tray till it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Push tray gently into center of the oven. Bake for about 45 minutes until center is just firm. Do not over-bake. Check for doneness after about 40 minutes or so by gently shaking the ramekins. If the center wiggles, give them some more time. Remove tray from oven, carefully lift ramekins out of the water with tongs and place on counter to cool for 15 mins. When they are down to room temperature, loosen edges by running a sharp knife around the edges of the custards. Cover each ramekin with plastic wrap or foil and chill in the refrigerator for 6-24 hours. When ready to serve, unwrap and leave custards on countertop for 15 min. Shake ramekin gently to loosen caramel, then unmold by holding a serving plate over each ramekin and turning it upside down. The custard will settle onto the plate with the caramel pooling around it. Store extra flans covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze them for future use. Preheat the oven to 325F. Lightly spray the insides of 8 medium (6 oz) ramekins with cooking spray.

    "content": "Recipe: Rich Maple Bison Chili with NESCAFE\nBrand: NESCAFÉ\nDescription: Bison is a rich source of protein, while being low in fat. Consuming less grass than cattle, bison is a reliable and abundant food source – providing not only nutrition for Indigenous people, but hides to make clothing and blankets, bones to create tools, jewelry, and fats used for cooking. All parts of the animal were used – and this chili recipe is a nod to sustainable cooking inspired by the First Nations and Métis communities.\nIngredients: 2 tbsp (45 mL) vegetable oil, 1 onion, minced, 2 celery ribs, sliced, 6 cloves garlic, minced, 1 1/2 lb (750 g) ground bison, 2 tbsp (30 mL) ground cumin, 2 tbsp (30 mL) smoked paprika, 2 tsp (10 mL) salt, 1 tsp (5 mL) black pepper, 2 tbsp (30 mL) tomato paste, 1 red bell pepper, diced, 1 can (15 oz) kidney beans, 2 medium Roma tomatoes, diced, 1 can (15 oz) pinto beans, 2 cups (500 mL) beef broth, 1 tbsp (15 mL) Nescafe Rich Instant Coffee, 1 tbsp (15 mL) Carnation Hot Chocolate Powder, 1 tsp (5 mL) cayenne, 1/4 + 2 tbsp (75 mL) Maggi Liquid Seasoning, 1 tbsp cornstarch, 1 tbsp (15 mL) maple syrup\nInstructions: In a large high-sided skillet or Dutch oven set over medium-high heat, add oil.

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 18 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until chili is thickened and flavourful. Add ground bison and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until starting to brown. Add onion, garlic, red pepper, and celery and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes, or until softened and fragrant. Add tomato paste, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until combined. Stir in Nescafe Rich Instant Coffee, Carnation Hot Chocolate Powder, chili powder, and Maggi Liquid seasoning. Stir and cook for 1 minute. Stir in beans, tomatoes, beef broth, barbecue sauce, and maple syrup. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 15 to 18 minutes, stirring occasionally, until chili is flavourful. In a small bowl or cup, combine cornstarch and 3 tbsp warm water to make a slurry. Add to chili mixture until thickened. Finish with maple syrup.

Place two silicon 12-count muffin pans on two baking sheets so they are easier to move around. Make sure you have room in your freezer for both pans. Mix graham cracker crumbs, Nesquik powder, brown sugar and melted butter in a medium bowl until combined, mixture will have the consistency of wet sand. Spoon 1½ -2 tablespoons of the crust mixture into each muffin cup and use the back of the spoon to pack it down tightly. Bake for five minutes and let the warm crusts cool for ten minutes before adding the filling on top. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium speed until smooth and creamy. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the Nesquik Strawberry Syrup, lemon juice, and vanilla extract; beat on medium-high speed until smooth and combined, about one minute. Make sure there are no large lumps of cream cheese. If there are lumps, keep beating until smooth. Set aside. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the cold whipping cream into stiff peaks at medium-high speed, about 3-5 minutes. Set aside. Using a rubber spatula, carefully fold the whipped cream into the cheesecake filling until combined. Combine slowly as you don’t want to deflate all the air in the whipped cream. You can use a spoon or piping bag to transfer the filling on top of the crusts. Spoon or pipe about 3 tablespoon of filling over each crust. Use the back of a wet spoon to smooth the tops so they are flat. Freeze the mini cheesecakes in the pans for three hours and up to two days Take the cheesecakes off the tray and place in the fridge 30 minutes before serving. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Line bottom of 15- x 10-inch (25 x 38 cm) rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Sift together flour, 1/2 cup (125 mL) Nesquik powder, baking powder and salt twice; set aside. Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks and 1/3 cup (75 mL) sugar for 5 to 7 minutes or until very thick, pale and light yellow in colour. Beat in vanilla; set aside. In separate bowl, beat egg whites (with clean beaters) on low speed until foamy. Increase speed to high; beat until soft peaks start to form. Sprinkle remaining sugar, 1 tbsp (15 mL) at a time, over top, beating until stiff, glossy peaks form. Fold half of the egg whites into egg yolk mixture until blended. Fold in remaining egg whites just until incorporated. Sprinkle flour mixture over top; fold in flour mixture just until blended. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth top.

Refrigerate until ready to glaze. Transfer cake to serving platter. Pour glaze over rolled cake, spreading to coat well (leave ends exposed to reveal roll if desired). Dust with Nesquik powder. Refrigerate until ready to serve. In heatproof bowl set over saucepan of barely simmering water, melt together chocolate chips, butter and maple syrup until smooth. (Alternatively, microwave in microwave-safe bowl at medium heat, stirring every 30 seconds, for 1 to 2 minutes or until melted.) Let stand for about 5 minutes or until cooled.

In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat together the butter and brown sugar at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about three minutes. Add egg and mix until combined. Reduce the speed to low and alternately mix in flour mixture and buttermilk in batches, beginning and ending with flour, scraping down the side of the bowl occasionally, and mixing until smooth. Using a medium sized ice cream scooper, scoop batter onto two parchment lined baking sheets keeping pies 2-3 inches apart. Let pies rest for 10 minutes before baking, they will keep their shape better that way. Bake for 10-12 minutes with one baking sheet on the top rack and one below it, swapping the position of the baking sheets halfway through cooking time to make sure each bakes evenly. Cook until tops are puffed and cakes spring back when touched. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed for three minutes until smooth and creamy. Add 2 cups of icing sugar and beat until smooth. Repeat with remaining sugar. Add cream and Nesquik Vanilla Syrup and beat until fluffy. Approximately two minutes. Add more icing sugar if the icing is too thin, add more cream if it’s too thick. Once the pie is cooled, take one, and pipe with filling on the flat side of the pie, place another pie on top and press down slightly to push the filling to the side. Repeat until all the pies are filled. Store in an airtight container for up to one week in the fridge.
